Installation instructions:

    We recommend using Python 3.8.
    Install Rasa with "pip3 install rasa".
    In one terminal, navigate to the project directory and run "rasa run actions" to start the custom actions server.
    In another terminal, navigate to the project directory and run "rasa shell". This is where you will talk to the bot.
    You may need to train the bot with "rasa train" before it will run.

Things the bot can respond to:

    Say hello
    Ask for the time
    Check to see if you have any mail (Use name Anthony, Adam, or Marshall for best results).
        The bot will randomly decide if you have mail or not and give the corresponding response.
    Ask for directions to...
        an airport (supports SFO or SJC, and should be able to tell you that it doesn't know the way to OAK)
        the restroom
        the freeway
    Make a reservation to stay at the hotel (Use name Anthony, Adam, or Marshall for best results)
        There is no data verification when making/cancelling a reservation. The bot will just assume whatever you say makes sense. Be nice :)
    Cancel a reservation at the hotel (Use name Anthony, Adam, or Marshall for best results)
    Try to pick a fight (and then surrender to the mighty machine)

Known Issues:

    The forms using a rule (e.g. restaurant form) show a warning about a slot type never sent during training.
    This is an issue with RASA that hasn't been fixed.  https://forum.rasa.com/t/getting-warning-in-rasa-core-processor/2892
